# Solution set for ETH Zurich ROS Course

This repository contains the solutions for the exercise sheets provided at ETH Zurich's course [Programming for Robotics - ROS](https://rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html). 

The solutions ar ein the order: 

1. Super Mega Bot (SMB) simulation with `teleop_twist_keyboard` and `roslaunch`: [smb_ws](smb_ws/)


The explanation for each sheet is provided in a separate README file in each folder. 

This is a work in progress and will be update as I complete more solution sheets.
